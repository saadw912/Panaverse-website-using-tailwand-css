        Program of Studies
         </h1>
         <p>
         This curriculum is intended for beginners who want to learn
          software development from the ground up. The first two quarters
           are shared by all specialities and are dedicated to studying
            Object-Oriented Programming and cutting-edge Full-Stack Web 2.0 
            development. It is going to be a year-long hybrid programme that includes 
            both onsite and online classes and is divided into four quarters of 
            13 weeks each. The emphasis will be on hands-on learning by educating 
            students to produce projects. To accommodate everyone, courses will
             be held primarily on weekends or after 6:00 p.m. (Pakistan Time) on weekdays.
              It employs a hybrid teaching format, with core onsite classes
               complemented by online Zoom laboratories and recorded videos.
